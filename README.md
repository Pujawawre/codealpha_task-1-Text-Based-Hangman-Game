🖇️Text-Based-Hangman-Game by using python 

🖇️Overview:

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. In this game, players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or exhausts all allowed guesses.

🖇️Features:

1) Word Selection: Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.

2) Guessing Mechanism: Allows players to guess letters and displays correctly guessed letters in their correct positions.

3) Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs and ensures that users only enter letters.

4) Game Status: Provides feedback on the number of remaining guesses and displays the current state of the word.

5) Restart Option: Allows players to restart the game after a win or loss.

🖇️Installation:

To set up and run the Hangman Game, follow these steps:

1) Clone or Download the Repository: bash git clone 
   https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game-python.git

Or download the ZIP file from the repository and extract it.

2) Navigate to the Project Directory: bash

cd hangman-game-python

3) Install Dependencies: This project requires Python 3. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. There are no additional libraries needed for the basic functionality of this game.

4) Run the Game: To start the game, execute the following command:

python hangman.py


🖇️Usage:


1) Starting the Game: Run the game using the command:

python hangman.py
You will be prompted to enter a letter guess.

2) Guessing Letters: Type a letter and press Enter. The game will reveal if the letter is in the word and update the display of the current state of the word.

3) Viewing the Hangman Figure: The game will progressively draw parts of the hangman figure for each incorrect guess. This helps you visualize how many guesses are left.

4) Winning or Losing the Game: The game ends when:

You correctly guess all the letters in the word (you win).
The hangman figure is fully drawn (you lose).

5) Restarting the Game: After the game ends, you will be given the option to restart. Follow the on-screen instructions to start a new game.
